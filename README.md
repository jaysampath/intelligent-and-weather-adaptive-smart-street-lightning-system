# intelligent-and-weather-adaptive-smart-street-lightning-system

This project’s target is to optimize the street lighting system. The electricity used for the street lights is placed at anywhere between twenty to forty percent of that produced
in India. An IoT based solution will keep control of which lights are working, and how much intensity will work the best in a particular scenario.This project aims at designing
smart street lighting system for energy saving of street lights. It controls the street lights based on intensity of light on the street. We can control the lights wirelessly
and also vary its intensity depending on the darkness level and the weather conditions. Whenever the change is detected on the street, the light will get automatically ON/OFF
or can be operated manually.

Components Used:
•	ESP8266 12E module
•	NRF modules
•	LED's(representing street lights)
•	LDR sensor
